We people are afraid of departure from our loved ones, we don't want to leave our loved ones. This separation may be due to getting a job, death or any other reason. We just have this feeling but we should understand nothing in this world is permanent. Situations change, we change, people change but why the hell we have to separate from our loved ones? Life is full of surprises, we just have to accept these unexpected situations and carry on. This is what life is all about.
