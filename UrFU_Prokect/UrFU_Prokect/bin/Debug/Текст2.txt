I am finally getting my first Govt. job but I have a fear that I would separate from my maternal grandparents. They are my life and I am their life support. God knows where will I get that job, where will be my posting. I wish I get a job in my hometown, which is difficult. But I hope I could see them always. I have best grandparents but this is time for my career, I have been unemployed for 3 years and now finally this is the first govt. job which is offering me very good salary plus there will be no more taunts from neighbours and relatives.
